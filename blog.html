                    <h1> Day 3:Scratch Project Take 2 Reflections</h1>
                    <p>This time we worked on Scratch for the second time it was truly different than what I last encountered,
                    What with it not being a maze I had to see what was I up to making and why. 
                    My idea of the project was to do something new and I did just that. My choice was to go simple 
                    although I did well in what I ass

                    <h1> Day 2: Lecture Day</h1>
                    <p>Day two we have our first lecture. CS50 has intrigued me what with the character speaker, he is fast pace but it's able for me to learn.
                    So far we have been shown binary digit which is 0101001 it is so far confusing to me but I am yet to learn it as the days go by. So far I've learned that binary digit is set differently
                    it is set by the power of 2. The greatest side being on the left and the lowest amount being on the right. Binary can interpret digits,colors and letters and much more that I have no idea yet about.
                    We've learned that compuntional thinking is problem solving. So I hope this helps problem solve my future.</p>

              <p>Day one we've began to start accessing many sites to see how we will access our websites. So far we have little idea
                  what will become of our days here in the elective. Much to come yet. </p>
